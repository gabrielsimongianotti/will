## 🚗💨 Personal Project: ESP32 Remote-Controlled Car with React Native App 📱  


Recently, I worked on an exciting personal project: building a remote-controlled car using an **ESP32** and a **React Native** mobile app.  
It was amazing to see how technology can turn ideas into reality. 💡  

With just a tap on my smartphone, I could control the car’s movements wirelessly through communication between the ESP32 and the app I developed.  
The challenges along the way taught me a lot, but seeing the project come to life was incredibly rewarding. 🚀
